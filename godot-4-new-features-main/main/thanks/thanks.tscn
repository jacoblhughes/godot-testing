[font_size=24]
We had so many things to show that we couldn't possibly have them all completely ready in time.

So, there's a little more to discover in the project's files!

Here are some additional interesting bits:

- in [b]additional/custom_resources[/b], you'll find a demonstration of custom resource exports, grouped exports, auto-generation documentation, and generally the new inspector panel and export features
- in [b]additional/POT_generation[/b], we explain how to generate POT (translation) files
- in [b]additional/snippets[/b], you'll find a good number of examples of the new GDScript features and syntax
- in [b]2d_particles[/b], there's an additional rainy scene
- in [b]networking[/b], you'll find no less than 6 different network  architectures, which we tried to keep as simple as we could, demonstrating different possible setups.

We didn't build those demos alone; We were greatly helped by:

- Fales
- Paulloz
- Tokage
- iFire
- Smix8
- Calinou
- Raulsntos
