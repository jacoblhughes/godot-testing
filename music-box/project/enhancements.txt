When the cat falls, the animation loops I am guessing due to code. For now it is fixed




	Spikes:
		Spikes are a classic obstacle in platformers. They can be placed on the ground or on walls to harm the player upon contact.
		Consider adding variations, such as moving spikes or spikes that emerge from the ground periodically.

	Moving Platforms:
		Moving platforms add an element of timing and precision to the gameplay. These platforms can move horizontally, vertically, or follow complex patterns.
		Include platforms that change direction or speed to increase difficulty.

	Pits and Gaps:
		Gaps in the floor or pits that the player must jump over create a sense of vertical challenge. Ensure that the player's jumping abilities are well-tuned to handle these gaps.

	Moving Obstacles:
		Enemies or hazards that move back and forth can be placed on platforms. This could include creatures, projectiles, or other dynamic elements.
		Adjust the speed and patterns of movement to vary difficulty.

	Breakable Platforms:
		Platforms that break or disappear after the player steps on them can add an element of urgency and strategy to the game.
		Allow the player to anticipate when a platform will break, requiring careful planning.

	Switches and Doors:
		Introduce switches that the player can activate to open doors or reveal new platforms. This adds puzzle-solving elements to your platformer.
		Combine switches with timed challenges to increase complexity.

	Moving Hazards:
		Hazards that move independently of platforms, such as rotating blades or rolling boulders, can create dynamic and engaging levels.
		Design levels that require the player to time their movements to avoid these hazards.

	Vertical Moving Platforms:
		Elevators or platforms that move vertically can create interesting level designs. Consider integrating them with other obstacles to increase difficulty.

	Climbable Surfaces:
		Ladders, vines, or other climbable surfaces add verticality to your levels. Ensure that the climbing mechanic is responsive and intuitive.

	Traps:
		Hidden traps or triggers that activate obstacles when the player approaches can add surprise and challenge.
		Include visual cues to hint at the presence of traps.
